        The cell simulation is a program that simulates a colony of cells 
        growth and deaths. It compares each cell with their neighbors to determine
        if the cell will die or be alive in the next step, doing 
        this to every cell for 100 steps.This program makes use of multiprocessing to handle the arrays, and
        it was tested with 10,000 x 10,000 array size, only taking less than
        20 minutes with 36 processes.
